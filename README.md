# Lunch App

## :scroll: Description
The Lunch App is built with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). This project was developed to learn more about animations in Compose.

There are 2 screens: a HomeScreen and a RestaurantScreen.

The goal of the app is to explore [Animation API](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation) of Jetpack Compose, so there are not any viewmodels, repositories, etc.
